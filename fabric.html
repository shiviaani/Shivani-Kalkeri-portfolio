          <p>Fabrics is a Publishing Design assignment that I recently have worked on as a part of Masters program.

          The goal of the assignment was to first list down all your influences. Amongst the many that I listed the one that I had a strong inclination towards was my love for fabrics and different materials.

          Here I have elaborated four major influences that are floral prints, block prints, african tribal prints and ethnic indian print.

          The fonts I have used are Avenir Next and Electra LH</p>
